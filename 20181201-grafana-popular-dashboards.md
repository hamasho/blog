# A List of Popular Grafana Dashboards

[Grafana](https://grafana.com/) is a beautiful front end
for data visualization and system metric monitoring.
With grafana, you can easily create you own dashboards
to watch what's happening on you system.
There are a number of panels and data sources provided by grafana eco system.
All you have to do is just combine those components.

But when I tried to find useful dashboards on ther
[online galary](https://grafana.com/dashboards),
it was a little bit difficult because it's not well organized.
I wanted to get the download ranking,
but the list is sorted by alphanumerical order and there are no other options.

So I scriped the web site and created the download ranking
of grafana dashboards.

Here is the top 10 list at this time (2018/12/01) with description.
In case you are more interestead, there is the top 100 list on
[this github page](https://github.com/hamasho/grafana-popular-dashboards).
